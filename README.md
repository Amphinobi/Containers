# Containers
The project was split into two:
The first group works on the vector, deque, stack and tail.
The second group works on the set, multiset, map, and unordered_map.
Most of the figures have been generated thanks to the code contained in / src:
- In the Methode.hpp file there are test functions for each type of container studied
- These methods are called in the main and the results are stored in 'figure'.
- Each 'figure' represents a curve,then which one can add a 'matlab_file'.
- Each 'matlab_file' allows the editing of a matlab file and the superposition of the curves on one or more figures.
- So we modified the code and executed 'main' several times by changing the methods called in the test loop to obtain a series of curves comparing the functions of the studied containers
